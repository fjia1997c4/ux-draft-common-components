# Angular Checkbox Component - PRD

## Overview
Create a reusable, accessible checkbox component for Angular applications based on the provided Figma design specifications. The component will support multiple states, proper accessibility features, and consistent styling.

## User Stories

### Primary User Stories
- **US-001**: As a developer, I want to use a consistent checkbox component across my Angular application
- **US-002**: As a user, I want to interact with checkboxes that provide clear visual feedback for different states
- **US-003**: As a user with accessibility needs, I want checkboxes that work with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- **US-004**: As a developer, I want to easily customize checkbox appearance and behavior

### Secondary User Stories
- **US-005**: As a developer, I want to group checkboxes and manage their state collectively
- **US-006**: As a user, I want to see error states when validation fails
- **US-007**: As a developer, I want to integrate the checkbox with Angular reactive forms

## Technical Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **Multiple States Support**
   - Default (unselected/selected)
   - Hover state
   - Focus state
   - Pressed state
   - Disabled state
   - Error state

2. **Accessibility Features**
   - ARIA labels and descriptions
   - Keyboard navigation support
   - Screen reader compatibility
   - Focus management

3. **Angular Integration**
   - Reactive forms compatibility
   - Template-driven forms support
   - Custom validation support
   - Change detection optimization

### Design System Specifications
Based on the Figma design files:

#### Colors
- **Primary Blue**: #1A70B3 (background selected)
- **Neutral Colors**: 
  - Neutral 100: #FCFCFC (checkmark)
  - Neutral 200: #EEEEEE (disabled background)
  - Neutral 500: #918F8F (disabled text)
  - Neutral 700: #0A0A0A (default text)
- **Error Red**: #960000 (error states)

#### Typography
- **Font Family**: Body-lg, PT Sans, 16px
- **Font Weight**: Regular (400)
- **Line Height**: 150%

#### Spacing
- **Vertical Padding**: 4px (c4-space-2x)
- **Horizontal Padding**: 4px (c4-space-01)
- **Space Between**: 16px (c4-space-1x)

#### Dimensions
- **Checkbox Size**: 20x20px with 4px radius
- **Border**: 2px weight
- **Focus Border**: 3-line border (outer black, middle white, inner black)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Component Structure
- Create base checkbox component
- Implement basic checked/unchecked states
- Add proper TypeScript interfaces
- Set up component styling

### Phase 2: State Management
- Implement all visual states (hover, focus, pressed, disabled)
- Add state management using Angular services
- Create proper event handling

### Phase 3: Accessibility & Forms Integration
- Add ARIA attributes
- Implement keyboard navigation
- Integrate with Angular reactive forms
- Add validation support

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Error state handling
- Group checkbox functionality
- Custom theming support
- Testing and documentation

## Success Criteria
- Component passes all accessibility audits
- Supports all specified visual states
- Works with Angular reactive forms
- Includes comprehensive unit tests
- Provides clear documentation and examples

## Dependencies
- Angular 20.0.0+
- Angular Forms
- Angular CDK (for accessibility features)

## Risks & Mitigations
- **Risk**: Complex state management
  - *Mitigation*: Use Angular services for centralized state
- **Risk**: Accessibility compliance
  - *Mitigation*: Use Angular CDK a11y module
- **Risk**: Performance with many checkboxes
  - *Mitigation*: Implement OnPush change detection
